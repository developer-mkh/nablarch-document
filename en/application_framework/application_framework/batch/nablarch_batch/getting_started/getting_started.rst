Getting Started
==========================================
By reading this chapter, you can get an image of the development of a batch based on the Nablarch batch application architecture.

Prerequisites
  The explanation of this chapter is based on :ref:`example_application`.
  The operating environment of the example application must be built in advance.

  .. tip::
    The following items of the example application are not explained in this chapter.
    For the following items, see :ref:`example_application`.

.. tip::
 In Nablarch batch application, since there is no difference in how to implement the application
 with :ref:`each time startup batch<nablarch_batch-each_time_batch>` and :ref:`resident batch<nablarch_batch-resident_batch>`,
 so Getting Started is not prepared separately for each.
 The difference between :ref:`each time startup batch<nablarch_batch-each_time_batch>`
 and :ref:`resident batch<nablarch_batch-resident_batch>` is only the handler configuration.
